# Project 4 - Jacob Padgett

## Elevator pitch

The state of Colorado has a large portion of their residential dwelling data that is missing the year built and they would like you to build a predictive model that can classify if a house is built pre 1980. They would also like you to build a model that predicts (regression) the actual age of each home.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

I was told not to repeat myself, so I'll skip this section as everything will be included below.

### GRAND QUESTION 1

#### Create 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980.

* Chart 1 is livearea v yrbuilt

  - ![]()

* Chart 2 is numbdrm v yrbuilt

  - ![]()

* Chart 3 is basement v yrbuilt

  - ![]()
